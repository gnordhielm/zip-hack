				A binnacle is a housing on the deck of a ship for the compass and other navigational tools. Binnacle, the app you're about to start using, is a housing for all of the tools a job seeker needs to carry out an intentional and successful search. We leverage user-generated data regarding the length and details of their job search to craft strategies that will work in your industry. If you're a full-time seeker, chances are you have a whole mess of resum√© files, a giant Excel sheet, and a ball of stress in your stomach. Binnacle is going to help you clean up and standardize the first two items - in hopes of dissolving the final one. Plan, don't panic.
